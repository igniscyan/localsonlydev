# LOFE - Local's Only Front-End

## What did I stumble upon?
This repository contains the front end source files for the [Locals Only Sound](localsonlysound.com) official website. They are a Music Group haiing from Toronto signed by Universal Media Group (UMG).

## How was it made?

As the boilerplate `README` junk from below may suggest, the foundations for our react app was created with Facebook's `create-react-app` NPM package (Link below). In addition to this, we have utilized [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com/) to make the CSS less of a migraine to everyone involved in the project. 

## Contributing
Find an issue you'd like to work on, and get cracking. We are following [ES6 Standards](http://es6-features.org/), and working very hard to keep everyone on the same page. So if you do anything byzantine, leave a comment that will help everyone else figure out what is going on. 

Commit your code to the appropriate branch, and include a short but descriptive commit message. (Once things are past the skeletal phases, NEVER PUSH TO MASTER UNLESS EXPLICITLY GIVEN PERMISSION).  Master branches should always work no matter how far back in the pipeline you go!

## Timeline

Expect this portion of the document to change often.

### *Boilerplate Below*
---


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
